# Titanic Passenger Survival Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic, using logistic regression. The Titanic dataset, which includes passenger information such as age, sex, ticket class, and more, serves as the basis for our analysis and model building.

## Features and Labels
The dataset contains the following features:
- `Pclass`: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- `Sex`: Sex (male/female)
- `Age`: Age in years
- `SibSp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- `Parch`: Number of parents/children aboard
- `Fare`: Passenger fare
- `Embarked`: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

The target variable is `Survived`, indicating whether a passenger survived or not (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:
- Handling missing values
- Converting categorical variables into numeric
- Feature scaling

## Model Building
We use logistic regression, a binary classification algorithm, to predict the `Survived` status based on the given features.

## Installation and Running the Project
To run this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system. You'll also need the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
